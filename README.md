## 🧠 Overview

PremierZone is divided into four core components:

1. **🧩 Backend (Spring Boot)**  
   Handles dynamic data manipulation, RESTful endpoints, and business logic for player and match data.

2. **💻 Frontend (ReactJS)**  
   An interactive interface for exploring real-time match stats, player performance, and prediction results.

3. **📊 Data Scraping (Python + Pandas)**  
   Automated scraping pipelines to collect and clean match statistics for 700+ players.

4. **🤖 Machine Learning (scikit-learn)**  
   Predicts match outcomes based on scraped and preprocessed data, integrating seamlessly with the backend.
